Exception Handling - exception handling is a process or method used for handling the abnormal statements in the code and executing them. 
Any error is an exception 

Type of Errors
 Syntax Error: When a user makes a mistake in the pre-defined syntax of a programming language, a syntax error may appear.
Runtime Error: When an error occurs during the execution of the program, such an error is known as Runtime error. 
               The codes which create runtime errors are known as Exceptions. Thus, exception handlers are used for handling runtime errors.
Logical Error: An error which occurs when there is any logical mistake in the program that may not produce the desired output,
               and may terminate abnormally. Such an error is known as Logical error.
