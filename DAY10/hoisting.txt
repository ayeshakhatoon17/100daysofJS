// Hoisting is used in functions it means we can call the function  anywhere without an order.
//we can call before the declaration of function or after the declaration yet it produces same result
// hoisting can be done only in functions


 ex: // in this case we have called function after declaration
     function isEven(num){
        if (num % 2 == 0){

            console.log(`number is even ${num}`)
          }
        else{
            console.log(`number is odd ${num}`) 
            }
       }
         isEven(9)

 ex2:
     isEven(9)  //here we called the function first then down we have declared
     
     function isEven(num){
        if (num % 2 == 0){

            console.log(`number is even ${num}`)
          }
        else{
            console.log(`number is odd ${num}`) 
            }
       }
    

    // Return
     The return statement stops the execution of a function and returns a value.
     after return  statement , it dosen't consider the remaining part

     ex:
        function myFunction(a, b) {
        // Return the product of a and b
        return a * b;
        console.log("i won't be considered")// this part dosen't considered coz return statement has given above
          }
